# Redux quiz group project

Project by Elin Elmvik Diczfalusy, Jessica Nygren Walhed, Daniel Vestin, Kriss Stockhaus & Katie Wu.
For making a Quiz with React Redux practicing global states, store, useSelector, dispatch, reducers etc.

## The problem

First we plan the project together what the Quiz would be about also making a design sketch to follow. We proceeded to work as much as we could as a group but also split up during day/evening. We tried to use the techniques that's associated with react redux as much as possible but also mixed up some 'old' techniques.

If we had more time we would've wanted to try implement more functions like a timer and counter. We also would've wanted to try out styled components a bit more.
